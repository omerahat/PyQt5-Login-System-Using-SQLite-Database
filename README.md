# PyQt5 Login System using SQLite Database
This project is a simple PyQt5 application that implements a login system using SQLite database. It allows users to log in and sign up, and provides validation for the input fields.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- Python 

- SQLite3

- PyQt5

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, you need to install PyQt5 and SQLite3. You can do that by running the following command:
```
pip install PyQt5 sqlite3
```
## Running the Application
To run the application, you need to execute the main.py file in the terminal or in an IDE of your choice.

```
python main.py
```
This will launch the GUI application.

## Usage
When the application is launched, it will display a login form. You can either log in with an existing account or sign up for a new account.

If you choose to sign up, you will be prompted to enter a username and password. Once you have entered your details, click the "Kayit ol" button to create your account.

If you choose to log in, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. If your credentials are correct, you will be logged in and greeted with a welcome message. Otherwise, you will be informed that there is no such user.
